These define how we operate, as well as our conduct, behavior, and standards to which we must adhere. Our strategy and execution model is affected by different political environments and a large number of regulatory requirements. We remain continually aware of these forces that influence our business, and we engage in political and regulatory decisions. This is fundamental to understanding wider political developments and the evolution of the regulatory environment, as well as fostering stakeholder trust. In recent times, international and national political systems have shown signs of fragmentation. This directly affects our business model. In 2017 alone, we saw crucial elections in France, the UK, and Germany, as well as a new US government whose Con- gress passed a comprehensive tax reform that had an immediate impact on our US tax position. The UK has formally declared its exit from the EU, and negotiations are under way. This will have repercussions on our structure, operations, client relationships, and staffing. Furthermore, wider political developments in the Euro zone (such as important national elections) will impact the stability of financial markets, market prices, and long-term investment decisions by companies. All of this affects our entire value chain.'\n"
